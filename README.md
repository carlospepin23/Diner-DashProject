# Diner-DashProject
In this repository, you will find a copy of the Diner Dash project developed in collaboration with Jeremy Morales (jeremy.morales1@upr.edu) as part of the projects evaluation for the Advanced Programming course (CIIC4010) in 2023. Our goal was to complete a Diner Dash game using the object-oriented language C++ and the openFrameworks platform.
